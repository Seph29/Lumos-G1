## Installation

2. Install the APK on the G1 (via Download, USB, ADB, etc.)
3. Start the application and click the INJECT button. After the first restart, start the application a second time and press INJECT again.
4. Enjoy !

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If your G1 is still stuck on the INNIOASIS logo, it is recommended to download the latest firmware from the official INNIOASIS website and flash it using SP Flash Tool.
> If you're not familiar with how to use SP Flash Tool, I strongly advise against using this application.
